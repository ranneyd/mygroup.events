    h1 Uh oh!
    p.flow-text Something bad happened. Whatever you were trying to do probably didn't work. We've logged this boo-boo and we're gonna smack a bandage on it as soon as possible. Thanks, and sorry for the inconvenience!

    p.flow-text Because of the inconvenience, here's a random cat. If you don't like that cat and you want a new one <a href="#" id="cat">click here</a>.
    div.center-align
        a(href="http://thecatapi.com/" target="_blank"): img#catImg(src="http://thecatapi.com/api/images/get?format=src&type=gif&size=med")
block scripts
    script(type="text/javascript").
        $("#cat").click(function(){
            console.log("cat");
            $("#catImg").removeAttr("src").attr("src", "http://thecatapi.com/api/images/get?format=src&type=gif&timestamp" + new Date().getTime())
        })
