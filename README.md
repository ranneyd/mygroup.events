# MyGroup.events

## What it is

MyGroup.events is a way to organize events for members of a specific group or organization.
Frequently, people will want to coordinate events within a group. For instance, an office might want
to plan an after-work happy hour, or a freshman class might want to organize trips to eat off campus
or see a movie. These events are often poorly organized: they take the form of a giant email or a
social media post. This is because people lack a tool to organize these meetings. Some websites
exist for organizing meetups, but they usually focus on meeting new people, not organizing events
with people you already know. 

MyGroup.events is the solution to this problem. MyGroup.events allows a group to make its own social
network that is based entirely on planning events. Members can either post large, premeditated
events like barbecues and camping trips or small, spontaneous events like a few people going for
drinks after work and wanting anyone who'd like to join in to come. The group can be invite only or
public (perhaps a church plans weekend activities but doesn't want to be exclusive to members). It
can allow anyone to post activities, or just members, or require an administrator sign off on a post
before it gets published (to filter inappropriate events). The events will then appear in several
layouts, including a list with the soonest event at the top and a calendar.

## Technologies

MyGroup.events will be made with Node.js and Express. It will be modularized as best as possible in
case someone wants to implement their own version instead of using [MyGroup.events](www.mygroup.events). The database
will be MongoDB and the front end will use [MaterializeCSS](materializecss.com).
