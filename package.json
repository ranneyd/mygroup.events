  "description": "MyGroup.events is a way to organize events for members of a specific group or organization.\r Frequently, people will want to coordinate events within a group. For instance, an office might want\r to plan an after-work happy hour, or a freshman class might want to organize trips to eat off campus\r or see a movie. These events are often poorly organized: they take the form of a giant email or a\r social media post. This is because people lack a tool to organize these meetings. Some websites\r exist for organizing meetups, but they usually focus on meeting new people, not organizing events\r with people you already know.",
